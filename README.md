fpga_data_logger
================

FPGA based data logger (LCD, ADC, UART &amp; I2C) 

The project is implemented on a DE0-Nano FPGA Development Board from Terasic. I have interfaced the on board 8 Channel 12 bit ADC, 3 axis accelerometer and a UART peripheral with the on board Altera Cyclone IV E series FPGA. I have also added a LCD Module to enable the user to view the sampled ADC data on a 16x2 LCD. 

The GUI is built in Visual Studio 2010 using Visual C#. So, the project is a windows only built at present.
