FPGA Data Logger
================

FPGA based data logger (LCD, ADC, UART &amp; I2C) 

![alt tag](http://s1.postimg.org/wfmay72jj/image.png)


The project is implemented on a DE0-Nano FPGA Development Board from Terasic. I have interfaced the on board 8 Channel 12-bit ADC, 3 axis accelerometer and a UART peripheral with the on board Altera Cyclone IV E series FPGA. I have also added a LCD Module to enable the user to view the sampled ADC data on a 16x2 LCD. 

You can find the project files here (if incase you just need to test the project):

The GUI is built in Visual Studio 2010 using Visual C#. So, the project is a windows only built at present.
